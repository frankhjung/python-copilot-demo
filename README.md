# GitHub Copilot Demonstration for reading Stock Quotes

A small Python program to demonstrate how to read stock quotes from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/).

## Method

1. read stock symbol from the command line
1. retrieve ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY from environment variable
1. call Alpha Vantage API to get stock quotes
1. store stock quotes to a Pandas dataframe
1. print to console
1. plot stock quotes to a chart (closing price by date) using Matplotlib
